### 📖 Abstract

Difference-in-Differences (DiD) is a popular quasi-experimental research design. Its standard form includes two groups and two periods, which many researchers find straightforward. However, practical applications can vary when researchers extend beyond the basic model. This article provides a structure for discussing various DiD designs and their respective estimators. It explores covariates, weights, multiple periods, and staggered treatments. The framework also applies to other advanced DiD methods.
